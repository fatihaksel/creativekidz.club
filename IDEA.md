## Summary / Idea

Families with children want to make sure they are doing meaningful activities together. CreativeKidz Club gathers and shares creative, fun, age-appropriate activities for kids. The platform is designed to crowd-source projects to work independently, lightly guided by an adult or as a group. The community has a wide variety of projects but focuses on building. Building is the practice of creating something where a need exists, and not being afraid to ask for help from others when you have a vision for something bigger. It also encourages users to learn new skills and have fun along the way.

## Elevator Pitch

We know that it is hard to keep kids busy at home, especially if parents want them engaged in a meaningful activity that helps them develop. The new normal for social distancing, many family members now work at home, while kids study and play. This creates a problem with families feeling pulled in several directions.

CreativeKidz platform allows families to work together on projects, without requiring a large amount of time investment from the parents. The kids stay engaged on interesting and potentially meaningful projects while allowing parents to multitask.

Families get stressed out when multiple agendas conflict

**There are two modes of operation for user:**

**Perform Projects:** CreativeKidz is a place to find creative, fun and easy to do activities for kids with a focus on creating things. The platform is easy to search and filter various activities, crafts or projects based on age, group size, geographic location or interest area. The platform includes an interactive forum where kids can show off their completed projects and comments on other’s contributions.
Submit Projects: The platform allows anyone to share an activity with a description and list of required tools and materials. The platform uses a templated approach to make it easy to describe a project in as much detail as needed for others to enjoy.


There is something for every kid regardless of age.

* **Toddlers:** many simple and independent tasks for engagement and skills building.
* **Preschoolers:** building projects in small groups for socialization
* **Elementary School kids:** A fun way to enhance the STEAM activities they learn in school.
* **Middle School young adults:** Competitive projects that are STEAM related
* **High School and beyond:** some practical ways to enhance life skills and build worthwhile professional “builder” skills. Focus on larger projects that require several people to cooperate on a common goal, working with others who have complementary skills.

In addition to project users, the platform allows mentors to guide projects by:

* Inviting users to a project.
* Can recommend specific projects for group to work on
* Can brand the group e.g. child care centers or robotics competition group name
* Can initiate individual or group discussions to facilitate and manage project.

Have Fun!
