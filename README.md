We know that it is hard to keep kids busy at home, especially if parents want them engaged in a meaningful activity that helps them develop. With the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, almost all of the family members now work at home at the same time kids study at home. 

We gather and share creative, fun, easy to do activities for kids. The platform is designed to crowd-source projects, activities for kids to work independently or as a group.

It is a knowledge-base, learning & sharing platform to keep kids entertained during the coronavirus crisis.

## Built With

Project is based on open-source Q&A software [Discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_(software))

* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Frontend
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - Backend Language
* [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) - Database
* [Discourse Development](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-install-discourse-for-development-using-docker/102009) - Discourse Development using docker. [Addon & Theme Building](https://www.broculos.net/2015/09/getting-started-with-discourse.html) - Getting Started with Discourse Development
* We used [The Socrata Open Data API (SODA)](https://dev.socrata.com/) to access the open data platform and created a python script to integrate the data.
* We have developed a customized theme for our web-app https://github.com/fatihaksel/creative-kidz-theme
* Please check out the [Installation file](./INSTALLATION.md)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Project is based on docker, hosted on Digital Ocean Droplets. [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) - Docker Command Line Interface docs
* Droplet specific codes are in the [droplet folder](./droplet/)

## Open Data Integration

We have integrated Buffalo Open Data ["Child Care Regulated Programs API"](https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs-API/fymg-3wv3). This data includes the licensed and registered child care programs in New York State.

We have integrated the child care centers that are located in Erie County. There are **499 registered child care centers** in Erie County.

## The Future Plans

* Continue to improve the platform's usability while developing age-appropriate programs based on user and community feedback.
* Add Childcare Centers as project leaders to help them to create a learning & sharing platform with their kids and parents. This may lead to premium features that help centers add value to families that extends beyond normal business hours.
* We plan to partner with grade through high schools and maker labs to enhance STEAM initiatives. We feel the big opportunity for this platform is to encourage kids to engage with thier hands and with thier minds. When they see a need in the world they should try to find a solution. If they can't accomplish it themselves, then they should reach out for help to create something bigger than themselves. This platform encourages them to collaborate starting at a young age and growing in sophistication over time.
* We will continue to work closely with mentors and startup activists in Buffalo to find meaningful projects worth incorporating.
